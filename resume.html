            <li><b><p>Using Deep Learning to Predict Single-Gene, Mitochondrial, and Multifactorial Genome Disorders<p>
                <ul><li><p>Project Summary:</b>  Developed a multi-class neural network to predict the type and subclass of genome disorders, such as Diabetes, Alzheimer's, Cancer, etc. This model aims to assist medical professionals in providing preemptive care to mothers at higher risk of having babies with genome disorders. By eliminating the need to wait until a later stage in pregnancy for diagnosis, this project contributes to safer pregnancies and reduces the need for abortions.</p></li>
